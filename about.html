                <h1>Get to know me</h1>
                <p>
                    Hi, I go by rhebok. I'm currently a student in computer science residing in France. I am passionate about making and playing video games. My main hobbies are developping video games and drawing pixel art but I dabble in all kinds of things that intrest me such as 3D modelling, sound & music, cuisine, photography and a lot more. I enjoy watching <a href="https://letterboxd.com/rhebok/" target="_blank">movies</a>, <a href="https://followmy.tv/u/rhebok" target="_blank">TV shows</a> and <a href="https://anilist.co/user/rhebok/" target="_blank">anime</a>, and also <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82243140-rhebok" target="_blank">reading books</a> and <a href="https://anilist.co/user/rhebok/mangalist" target="_blank">comics</a>.

                <h2>Name origin</h2>
                <p>
                    My real name is hard to pronounce for many people so I decided to use rhebok instead. It's the name of an animal that many people don't know about. The reason for this choice was an attempt at spreading awareness of its existence. However, this backfired and I am now often jokingly associated with the shoe brand that is also named after the animal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's a short description of the animal from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_rhebok" target="_blank">its Wikipedia page</a> :
                    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_rhebok">The grey rhebok or grey rhebuck, locally known as the reebok in Afrikaans, is a species of antelope native to South Africa, Lesotho, and Eswatini. The specific name capreolus is Latin for 'little goat'.</blockquote>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>
                    After graduating from high school, where I was first formally introduced to programming, I was accepted at the <a href="https://www.iut.univ-paris8.fr/" target="_blank">IUT de Montreuil</a> where I graduated with a computer science degree. After graduating I took a year off and travelled all over Europe. I visited Greece, Corse, Austria, Bosnia, and I also went back to my home country, Serbia, for a few months. When I returned to France I worked as a carpenter before applying to continue my education in computer science at the local university. I am currently a student in computer science at <a href="https://www.univ-paris8.fr/" target="_blank">Universit√© Paris 8</a>.

                <h2>My favorite things</h2>
                <h3>Video games</h3>
                <p>
                    I enjoy playing everything from older "retro" video games to the newest triple-A titles. Some of my favorite game franchises are : Monster Hunter, Assassins Creed, Prince of Persia, The Elder Scrolls, Castlevania (both old and new), Ninja Gaiden (both old and new).
                </p>

                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Media</h3>
                <p>
                    A lot of the media that I consume is in the fantasy genre. I also really like feudal settings, whether they are based on reality or fiction. I have also seen a lot of horror movies. Almost all of the books I have ever read were either fantasy or science fiction. My favorite books are Ursula K. Le Guin's <cite>Earthsea</cite> and the science fiction magazine <cite>Visions of Humanity</cite>.
