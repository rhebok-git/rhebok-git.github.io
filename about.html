                <h1>Get to know me</h1>
                <p>
                    Hi, I go by rhebok. I'm currently a student in computer science residing in France. I can speak and read 3 languages and I am learning more. I am passionate about making and playing video games. My main hobbies are developping video games and drawing pixel art but I dabble in all kinds of things that intrest me such as 3D modelling, sound & music, cuisine, photography, languages and a lot more.

                <h2>Name origin</h2>
                <p>
                    My real name is hard to pronounce for many people so I decided to use rhebok instead. It's the name of an animal that many people don't know about. This was an attempt at spreading awareness of its existence. However, it backfired and I am now often jokingly associated with the shoe brand that is also named after the animal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's a short description of the animal from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_rhebok" target="_blank">its Wikipedia page</a> :
                    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_rhebok">The grey rhebok or grey rhebuck, locally known as the reebok in Afrikaans, is a species of antelope native to South Africa, Lesotho, and Eswatini. The specific name capreolus is Latin for 'little goat'.</blockquote>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>
                    After graduating from high school, where I was first formally introduced to programming, I was accepted at the <a href="https://www.iut.univ-paris8.fr/" target="_blank">IUT de Montreuil</a> where I graduated with a computer science degree. After graduating I took a year off and travelled all over Europe. I visited Greece, Corse, Austria, Bosnia, and I also went back to my home country, Serbia, for a few months. When I returned to France I worked as a carpenter before applying to continue my education in computer science at the local university. I am currently a student in computer science at <a href="https://www.univ-paris8.fr/" target="_blank">Universit√© Paris 8</a>.

                <h2>Computer science</h2>
                <p>
                    I have always been very interested in programming : I remember reading an Introduction to Java <abbr title="electronic book">e-book</abbr> on my first Android smartphone on the subway while commuting to my middle school. Ever since then I've been going in that direction for many different reasons, but mainly because I love it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today I know several programming languages, however I don't think that I've mastered any of them, the same as I don't think that I've mastered any of the natural languages that I can speak.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know how to create websites, from scratch or by using frameworks. I am also acquainted with Node.js. I have had my fair share of database from PostgreSQL to MySQL. I have unfortunately had to use PHP before. I have ventured into the depths where I learned Racket and Objective-C. I spent countless hours trying to figure out why I was getting seg faults but then I discovered C++. And of course, last but not least, I know Python.

                <h2>Things I enjoy</h2>
                <h3>Video games</h3>
                <p>
                    I enjoy playing everything from older "retro" video games to the newest triple-A titles. Some of my favorite game franchises are : Monster Hunter, Assassins Creed, Prince of Persia, The Elder Scrolls, Castlevania (both old and new), Ninja Gaiden (both old and new). I like immersing myself into the world of the game, this is maybe the reason why I am so infatuated with triple-A video games.

                <p>
                    Some of the indie games that I consider as really great video games when it comes to game design :

                        <li><cite>Downwell</cite></li>
                        <li><cite>Cyber Hook</cite></li>
                        <li><cite>Gish</cite></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Media</h3>
                <p>
                    I enjoy immersing myself into interesting and detailed worlds, I sometimes do that by watching movies, TV shows and anime, and also by reading books and comics. A lot of the media that I consume is in the fantasy genre. I also really like the feudal setting, whether it is based on reality or fiction. I have seen <b>a lot</b> of horror movies. Almost all of the books I have ever read were either fantasy or science fiction. My favorite books are Ursula K. Le Guin's <cite>Earthsea</cite> and the science fiction magazine <cite>Visions of Humanity</cite> which has some of my favorite short stories.
